      In addition to what our tokenomics has set aside for marketing, every raid will act as a raffle that will help us achieve our ambitious marketing goals much faster while rewarding you for your involvement.

    b: "In every raid, we will be creating a unique NFT collection in collaboration with multiple talented digital artists. The loot (rewards) will be distributed to the raiders (contributors) as follows:"

    b1: "The top three raiders will obtain a <0>legendary NFT</0> (rarity: {{rarity}})"
    b2: "Five raiders will obtain an <0>epic NFT</0> (rarity: {{rarity}})"
    b3: "Twenty raiders will obtain a <0>rare NFT</0> (rarity: {{rarity}})"

      The probability of obtaining a NFT is determined by the percentage of contribution, and the NFTs will have multiple utilities inside our platform. Support DeSports Network and make your investment grow up while obtaining an unique valuable piece in return.
