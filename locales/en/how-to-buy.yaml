    recommendation: For ease of use, this set of instructions is recommended to be read on a separate device from the one you’ll be performing the wallet set-up and token purchase on. This will take approximately 15-30 minutes if you're new.

      bullets:
        - In you are using Trust wallet, tap the icon in the top-right hand side and search for "DeSports Network". If it's not there, type "Custom" on the search bar and click on the option “Add Custom Wallet”. Proceed to change the Network to “Smart Chain”. Paste the Contract Address. 

        - If you are using Metamask wallet, tap the dropdown menu on the top-right hand side and ensure you are in the “Smart Chai” Network. Then, proceed to the bottom of the screen and click on “Add Tokens”. On the next page, paste the Token Address.

        - On both wallets, ensure the token is DESP, and the decimals (Tokens of Precision) is set to 9.

        - Click "Done" or “Add Token” and you should now have DeSports Network added to your wallet!

    step_3:

      description: | 
        Buy BNB with a credit card on Trust wallet, you can use the instruction here: https://trustwallet.com/buy-bnb/

        To buy BNB on Centralized Exchange (CEX), please follow the instructions on the exchange. This step may require KYC verification, so have documents ready to prove your identity.
      
        Once this is done, you should send your BNB to your wallet if you didn’t buy it directly on Trust. After sending BNB to your wallet, there may be a delay while your transaction is processed. Be patient, this is normal!
      
      warn: If the transaction won't go through, you may need to contact your bank to allow international transactions.
