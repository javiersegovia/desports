  guide:
    recommendation: For ease of use, this set of instructions is recommended to be read on a separate device from the one you’ll be performing the wallet set-up and token purchase on. This will take approximately 15-30 minutes if you're new.

    step_1:
      title: "Step 1: Create a wallet"
      description: Download <0>Trust Wallet</0> or <1>Metamask</1> and create a wallet. Keep your phrase a secret! Never share it with anyone and store it properly! Make sure to copy the contract address below!
      contract_address: Contract address

    step_2:
      title: "Step 2: Add DeSports Network to your Wallet"
      description:
        a: |
          <0><1>If you are using Trust wallet</1>, tap the icon in the top-right hand side and search for "DeSports Network". If it's not there, type "Custom" on the search bar and click on the option “Add Custom Wallet”. Proceed to change the Network to “Smart Chain”, and then paste the Contract Address.</0>

          <2><3>If you are using Metamask wallet</3>, tap the dropdown menu on the top-right hand side and ensure you are in the “Smart Chain” Network. Then, proceed to the bottom of the screen and click on “Add Tokens”. On the next page, paste the Contract Address.</2>

        b: On both wallets, ensure the token is <0>DESP</0>, and the decimals (Tokens of Precision) is set to 9.
        c: Click "Done" or “Add Token” and you should now have DeSports Network added to your wallet!

    step_3:
      title: "Step 3: Buy \"Binance Coin\" (BNB)"
      description:
        a: "Buy BNB with a credit card. If you are on Trust Wallet, you can use the instructions here: <0>https://trustwallet.com/buy-bnb/</0>"

        b: |
          To buy BNB on Centralized Exchange (CEX), please follow the instructions on the exchange. This step may require KYC verification, so have documents ready to prove your identity.
      
          Once this is done, you should send your BNB to your wallet if you didn’t buy it directly on Trust. After sending BNB to your wallet, there may be a delay while your transaction is processed. Be patient, this is normal!
      
      warn: If the transaction won't go through, you may need to contact your bank to allow international transactions.

    step_4:

          Once your transaction has been cleared, and you have BNB on your Trust Wallet, Go to DApps (or "Browser" for iPhones) at the bottom of the main screen.

          Open the DApps, or Browser, section and find PancakeSwap and open it. Connect your Trust Wallet in the top-right. Scroll down a little to the "Exchange" box.
