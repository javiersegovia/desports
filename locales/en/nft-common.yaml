    - title: How do I receive my NFT reward? What about $DESP?
      description: |
        When we meet a goal, we will do a live stream to show you the NFT winners. After that, we will send them the NFTs.

        Once the next step in this feature is implemented, everyone will be able to "burn" the NFT: we will pay you its value in $DESP, and we will reduce the overall NFT supply. This will increase the price of the remaining NFTs, but the "burn price" will remain the same.
    - title: How do you calculate the NFT value in $DESP?
      description: |
        We will split every income received by the raids:
          
        80% will be used to achieve the specific goals of the raid.
        20% will be used as a "budget" that will determine the price of the NFTs.

        For example: for a total raised amount of 50BNB (including two or three goals), we will use 40BNB to finance the goals and 10BNB to backup the values of the NFTs.
    - title: What are the use cases of the NFT?
      description: |
        The NFTs will play a big role in the core platform, including (but not limiting to) avatars, trophies, achievements, and donations, among other features, like available museums in your profiles, and integrations with AR. Besides that, we will include the NFTs in special parts of our branding, merchandise, and platform overall.

        We will be creating a lore regarding the NFTs. These first use cases will be part of the foundations of the ecosystem that we intend to develop much more.
    - title: How many NFT Collections will exist?
      description: 'We want to make every collection special, so there will be all kind of collections in the platform. We want to make the collections design style related to the games that we will be integrating, and by featuring multiple digital artists, we will make sure to include all the styles: from 2D cartoons to realistic 3D models.'
    - title: What kind of things are you going to include in the NFT Collections?
      description: 'We will be building a lore involving our platform and we want every NFT to have real utility, so you can expect all kind of things: characters, trophies, achievements, and special items.'
    - title: How is the artist rewarded?
      description: When the raider receiving the NFT decides to keep it instead of burning it, we will pay 90% of the value to the artist in BNB, and the other 10% will used to buy back $DESP and support the ecosystem through the eSports financing wallet.
    - title: I am a Digital Artist. How can I collaborate with you?
      description: That's great! Send us an email to <0></0> and we will be in touch.
    - title: Is there another way to obtain the NFTs besides the raids?
      description: Depending on the rarity, certain NFTs will be available to buy at the NFT Marketplace. When we release future platform features, there will be another options too, like winning them through tournaments and special events, or by exchanging them with another user.
    - title: What are you going to do with the raised funds?
      description: "100% of the raised amount will be used to finance the goals of the raids. This includes all incomes: Raid direct donations, NFTs sold through the Marketplace, and even the profit generated by the DeSports Network merchandise."
