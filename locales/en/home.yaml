    $DESP is a deflationary token launched on July 12th, 2021, running on the BSC Network. Wallets will only be able to hold a maximum of 2% of the total supply, with a 0.33% of the total supply limitation per transaction. 
    Every transaction will consist of a 10% fee, which will be applied in the following manner:

  - title: 4% Automatic Liquidity Pool
    description: Locked until the year 2088. This liquidity fee will be saved in the smart contract until it reaches 0.1% of the total supply. At this point, the contract will automatically sell the $DESP for BNB in PCS and add it as liquidity.
  - title: 0.5% Burned Per Transaction
