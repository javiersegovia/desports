It takes a lot of networking, experience, contacts, and money to have exposure, or thrive.\n\nThis is why we're developing the DeSports Network.\n\nDeSports Network aims to be the largest decentralized platform for Esports events, NFT trophies and achievements. Creating, supporting, and providing a stage for players, teams, and eSports enthusiasts through the blockchain.\n\nDeSports Network is introducing the DeSports (\"DESP\") token, a new cryptocurrency on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Network. DESP, alongside a smart contract platform, will provide video game players, teams, fans, game developers, content creators and gaming communities the required crypto-backed value and tools for tournaments, one-on-one action, marketplaces, betting, fan support and team/player backing.\n\nUsers will be able to create, experience, and compete against each other, having complete control of their own events, without the need of paying commissions or having overseers/regulators through the entirety of the process.\n\nEvery event in the DeSports platform will be owned and operated by the community, giving them full control over their events.\n\nDeSports Network is changing the way we game..."

      "content": "DeSports Network is a fair, transparent, open, sustainable, peer-to-peer ecosystem which will allow anyone to participate in the world of eSports, earn rewards, NFTs, and achievements. All of this, without third-party involvement, by interacting through the blockchain, utilizing the DESP token as the fuel that fires this platform.\n\nAs a true DAO, DeSports will be designed to be completely automated and decentralized. DeSports Network will utilize a decentralized consensus algorithm capable of meeting the performance requirements of applications on the blockchain​. Under this algorithm, those who hold tokens on the blockchain and utilize them on the DeSports platform will be able to fund and crowdfund challenges, competitions, tournaments, prize pools, special events, spectator duels, and even support their favorite eSports athletes.\n\nThe users of the ecosystem will consist of investors, individual players, teams, event organizers, spectators, sponsors, and fans.\n\nDeSports aims to change the competitive video game business model by taking away the “business” aspects of it, giving the power back to the people."

However, it was only in the late 2000s that the industry went on to be truly monetized.\n\nAccording to studies, there’s an 838% year-over-year growth rate of eSports investments.\n\nAs the video game ethos continues to grow on a global scale, DeSports Network will help eSports reach its full potential, propelling it to the next echelon of its evolution, improving the way we currently experience it."

In second place there’s North America, with total revenues of $252.8 million.\n\nAccording to Satista, 2021 will see revenues of 25.1 million in streaming and 32.3 million in digital.1 With DeSports Network, these amounts can be redistributed to holders and users of the DESP token."

It’s also set to surpass American Baseball audiences, having only 500 million viewers a year.\n\n920 million people a year in viewership is expected by 2024, according to a Newzoo article. This is an exponential +9.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2021 and 2024\n\nDeSports Network aims to onboard 05-10% of the marketplace by 2023, attaining 46-92 million users in our ecosystem through the development of our state-of-the-art platform, strong tokenonics and massive marketing campaigns."

This aspect of eSports has been around since the sports inception.\n\nBetting on eSports is currently deemed the 7th largest in the world, putting it at the same level as betting on golf or tennis. With eSports continuing to expand, growing a greater audience, betting will therefore increase as well.\n\nBetting on eSports may perhaps appear different to traditional sports betting, but eSport action is the same as wagering on soccer, football, basketball, or horse racing.\n\nSo, how do we integrate this into our ecosystem? DeSports Network aims to develop the option to “duel” or “cheer” for your favorite player, or team, earning DESP and other rewards in the process. It’s exactly the same as making and winning a traditional bet."

This token architecture will be employed not only to power the ecosystem, but to finance the token base infrastructure while the DeSports Network platform is developed.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC) utilizes the BNB token as gas for transaction fees. BSC further elevates BNB to a proof-of-stake token for the new Proof of Stake Authority (PoSA) consensus powered by validators and delegators.\n\nDeSports Network operates on this blockchain for its low fees and the scalability that this represents. It should be noted that it is within our plans to expand onto ETHEREUM (ETH) and MATIC-Polygon. This will be achieved through a bridge, where investors can send their token onto another blockchain for processing the transactions. This means that our developers can continue to run the DApp on Ethereum, using ERC-20 token standards and tapping into Ethereum’s developer & user community, or Polygon’s scalability.\n\nThe right blockchain and smart contract solutions have the basic foundations necessary to develop any type of protocols for a network, creating a \"blockchain\" for what is pursued would result in an overkill of resources.",

As long as there’s someone who will counter your bet with at least the same quantity as your DESP wager, up to a predetermined time before the event begins, you will qualify to form part of the betting feature in the DeSports Network.\n\nAnother type of bet that will be available are in-play bets, where you bet on events in the match while it is taking place."

Game streams are the new form of entertainment, replacing traditional television and cinema for example. Viewers will be able to donate and tip their favorite streamers and players in DESP.\n\nUsers of the platform will be able to receive donations directly, without the need for KYC, or information; simply by using the DESP token.\n\nUnlike other platforms, users and broadcasters won’t need to apply for any partnership program. Users of the platform through the DESP token will get 100% of the profit from the advertisement and subscription revenue received by them.
